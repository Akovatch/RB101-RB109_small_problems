# Triangle Sides

# A triangle is classified as follows:

# equilateral All 3 sides are of equal length
# isosceles 2 sides are of equal length, while the 3rd is different
# scalene All 3 sides are of different length
# To be a valid triangle, the sum of the lengths of the two shortest sides
# must be greater than the length of the longest side, and all sides must have
# lengths greater than 0: if either of these conditions is not satisfied,
# the triangle is invalid.

# Write a method that takes the lengths of the 3 sides of a triangle as arguments,
# and returns a symbol :equilateral, :isosceles, :scalene, or :invalid depending
# on whether the triangle is equilateral, isosceles, scalene, or invalid.

# Examples:

# triangle(3, 3, 3) == :equilateral
# triangle(3, 3, 1.5) == :isosceles
# triangle(3, 4, 5) == :scalene
# triangle(0, 3, 3) == :invalid
# triangle(3, 1, 1) == :invalid

def triangle(side1, side2, side3)
  sides = [side1, side2, side3].sort
  case
  when sides[0] + sides[1] <= sides[2] || sides.include?(0) then :invalid
  when sides[0] == sides[1] && sides[1] == sides[2] then :equilateral
  when sides[0] == sides[1] || sides[1] == sides[2] then :isosceles
  else :scalene
  end
end

p triangle(3, 3, 3) == :equilateral
p triangle(3, 3, 1.5) == :isosceles
p triangle(3, 4, 5) == :scalene
p triangle(0, 3, 3) == :invalid
p triangle(3, 1, 1) == :invalid

# LS Solution: basically the same as mine, but uses max rather than sort.

# def triangle(side1, side2, side3)
#   sides = [side1, side2, side3]
#   largest_side = sides.max

#   case
#   when 2 * largest_side > sides.reduce(:+), sides.include?(0)
#     :invalid
#   when side1 == side2 && side2 == side3
#     :equilateral
#   when side1 == side2 || side1 == side3 || side2 == side3
#     :isosceles
#   else
#     :scalene
#   end
# end
