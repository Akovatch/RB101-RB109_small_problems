# Fibonacci Numbers (Last Digit)
# In the previous exercise, we developed a procedural method for computing the
# value of the nth Fibonacci numbers. This method was really fast, computing
# the 20899 digit 100,001st Fibonacci sequence almost instantly.

# In this exercise, you are going to compute a method that returns the last
# digit of the nth Fibonacci number.

# Examples:

# fibonacci_last(15)        # -> 0  (the 15th Fibonacci number is 610)
# fibonacci_last(20)        # -> 5 (the 20th Fibonacci number is 6765)
# fibonacci_last(100)       # -> 5 (the 100th Fibonacci number is 354224848179261915075)
# fibonacci_last(100_001)   # -> 1 (this is a 20899 digit number)
# fibonacci_last(1_000_007) # -> 3 (this is a 208989 digit number)
# fibonacci_last(123456789) # -> 4

# this is the solution LS expected you to come up with...however, it is undable to compute the last digit past
# the 1,000,000th number.

def fibonacci_last(nth)
  fibonacci(nth).to_s.chars.pop.to_i
end

def fibonacci(nth)
  first, last = [1, 1]
  3.upto(nth) do
    first, last = [last, first + last]
  end

  last
end


# LS solution: This is able to computer very far down the sequence, above the 1,000,000th number. It reduces numbers
# down to their last digit only during each calculation, which saves memory.

def fibonacci_last(nth)
  last_2 = [1, 1]
  3.upto(nth) do
    last_2 = [last_2.last, (last_2.first + last_2.last) % 10]
  end

  last_2.last
end
