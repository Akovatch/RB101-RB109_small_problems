# Write a method that determines and returns the ASCII
# string value of a string that is passed in as an argument.
# The ASCII string value is the sum of the ASCII values of
# every character in the string. (You may use String#ord
# to determine the ASCII value of a character.)

def ascii_value (str)
  ascii_arr = str.chars.map { |char| char.ord }
  ascii_arr.sum
end

ascii_value('Four score') == 984
ascii_value('Launch School') == 1251
ascii_value('a') == 97
ascii_value('') == 0

# LS solution: sum variable uncluded in .map argument

def ascii_value(string)
  sum = 0
  string.each_char { |char| sum += char.ord }
  sum
end

# Further Exploration
# There is an Integer method such that:

char.ord.mystery == char

# where mystery is our mystery method.
# Can you determine what method name should be
# used in place of mystery? What happens if you
# try this with a longer string instead of a
# single character?

# Answer = .chr (a method which converts ascii # to character)
